# Computational-Fluid-Dynamics
Repository for the Graduate level CFD course. It includes all the projects I coded in C language, as well as the results. This course relied heavily on Partial Differential Equations, Aerospace Computational Techniques, and C programming. All the plots/figures were generated in MATLAB.
