# Computational-Fluid-Dynamics
Repository for the Graduate level CFD course. It includes all the projects I coded in C language, as well as the results. This course relied heavily on Partial Differential Equations, Fluid Mechanics, Aerospace Computational Techniques, and C programming. All the plots/figures were generated in MATLAB, using the data generated by the C source codes.
